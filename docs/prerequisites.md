# Setup Your Machine

Here are list of applications required to setup development environment on Mac.
It's also recommended that you refer to our Glossary page

##1. iTerm2

Download iTerm2 from [http://iterm2.com](http://iterm2.com). Drag and drop the
app into your Applications folder.

##2. ZSH

1. Open iTerm2 window.
1. Go to [http://ohmyz.sh](http://ohmyz.sh), scroll down, copy and paste the
installation line into iTerm2 window (we'll call this **terminal**).
2. If Zshell is not activated immediately, quit iTerm2 and open again.


##3. Homebrew

Go to [http://brew.sh](http://brew.sh), find, copy and paste the installation
line into terminal.

To make sure it's installed properly, type `which brew` and it should reply
you with something like `/usr/local/bin/brew`

##4. Atom Editor

Download Atom from [http://atom.io](http://atom.io). Drag and drop the app into
your Applications folder.
If you start the editor on OSX for the first time, you should click at
"Atom > Install Shell Commands"

Optionally, you can install these packages to help us deal with Python syntax:

1. [autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python)
1. [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8)

To install Packages, press `âŒ˜+,` or from menu, `Atom -> Preferences`.
Click Install tab and search the package name, then click Install.

Click Packages tab to show or remove packages installed. It's safe to try one package and remove it so don't worry about that.

##5. Git

We'll be using local git and Github.

- Check if you already have git by typing `git` in terminal. If you get a ton
of output, you already have it. If not, install via Brew by typing
`brew install git`

- If you're not familiar on how git works, a good interactive tutorial can be
found on
[https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- Create a profile on [GitHub](https://github.com)

##6. Slack

Team TechLadies uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) for daily communications and
it has downloadable Mac app [here](https://slack.com/downloads)

##7. Python

Mac comes with Python. Try typing `python --version` into terminal and
it will show you which version installed. Alternatively, you can also install
via Homebrew by typing `brew install python`.

The difference is that if you install via Homebrew, the Python binary will be
placed under `/usr/local/bin/python` and it also automatically install `pip`
Python package manager.

We are using Python 2.7.11 for this project.

##8. Virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper

Steps to configure Virtualenv:

1. From terminal, type `sudo pip install virtualenv` wait until completed.
2. Next, type `sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper` wait until completed.
3. Next, type `export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs`. This will place all your virtualenv
under your `HOME_DIRECTORY/Envs`
4. Next, type `echo 'export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs' >> ~/.zshrc`
5. Next, type `echo 'source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh' >> ~/.zshrc`
6. Next, type `mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME`
7. Next, type `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`

### Test virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper

1. Open new terminal session and type `mkvirtualenv myproject`.
It should output few lines and the prompt on the left will indicate your
current active virtualenv which is `(myproject)`
2. To exit the virtualenv, type `deactivate`, the prompt will go normal again.
3. To enter the virtualenv again, type `workon myproject`.
4. You can create more virtualenv and to list all virtualenv you have,
type `workon` only.
5. To delete a virtualenv, type `rmvirtualenv myproject`

Any Python packages installed in this virtualenv only valid within this
virtualenv. To list the packages installed, type `pip freeze`.

## And that's a wrap!

Looks like we're good to go!
