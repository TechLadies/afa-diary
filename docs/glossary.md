# Glossary

During our journey of learning how to build a full-stack Django project,
we will learn many new technical terms. We will try to keep track of them
in this glossary.

**Ansible**
Ansible is a tool to "provision" servers. That means it helps to install
software on a server in an automated, scripted and repeatable way.

**Branch**

**Checkout**

**Commit**

**Django**

**Droplet**

**Full Stack**

**Git**

Git is a version control system. You can turn a normal folder on your hard disk
into a "repository". When you do that, Git will keep track of all changes made
to all files. You can then "commit" your changes and review them in a log or
even go back to an older version of your files. When working on a project with
a team, this helps to keep track about who did what and when.
