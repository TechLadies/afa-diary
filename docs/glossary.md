# Glossary

During our journey of learning how to build a full-stack Django project,
we will learn many new technical terms. We will try to keep track of them
in this glossary.

**Ansible**
Ansible is a tool to "provision" servers. That means it helps to install
software on a server in an automated, scripted and repeatable way.

**Branch**

**Checkout**

**Commit**

**Django**

**Droplet**

**Full Stack**

**Git**

Git is a version control system. You can turn a normal folder on your hard disk
into a "repository". When you do that, Git will keep track of all changes made
to all files. You can then "commit" your changes and review them in a log or
even go back to an older version of your files. When working on a project with
a team, this helps to keep track about who did what and when.

**Master Branch**

**Merge**

**Pull**

Pull is to extract the latest version of the master branch and other branches from Git so that the user can work off the latest version of a repository.

**Push**

When a user is done with making changes to their branch they can "push" their changes to the master. By doing so, they update the master with the changes that they have committed.

**Rebase**

**Repository**

**Staged**

When a user has made changes to a repository they can add those changes. By doing so the user "stages" their changes. Only staged changes can be committed.

**Terminal**

The Terminal is the part of the computer where programmers can program information and data into the computer.
